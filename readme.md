## How to use rig
The rig how-to is in the blend file. Did not script FK-to-IK snapping or vice versa.

## Terms of use
You're free to use the model in any project, be it commercial or non-commercial,
without any restraint or credit. Although, any credit to the artist would be
appreciated.

I've named the character solely for my convenience. You can rename it to anything
else.

This model must not be resold.

If possible, I would like to know where this model is being used. This is just me
being inquisitive.
